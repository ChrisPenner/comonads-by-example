# Comonads By Example - Monadic Party 2019

Welcome! Here's where I'm keeping all my resources for the talk; inside [`src`](./src) you'll find a collection of
(hopefully) interesting examples of many different types of Comonads; as well as from-scratch implementations of
each of them.

# Workshop Attendees:

If you plan to attend the sessions you may find it helpful to do the following ahead of time:

1. `git clone git@github.com:ChrisPenner/comonads-by-example.git`
2. `cd comonads-by-example && stack build`

Also please come with some of your own questions! I'd love to make the session as interactive as possible
