# Comonads By Example - Monadic Party 2019

Hey folks; here's the repo for a talk I gave about comonads at Monadic Party 2019!

You can find the [Slides Here](./docs/rendered); and all the code used in examples (of varying quality and completeness) [here](./src)

You can set it up to run the examples like so:

1. `git clone git@github.com:ChrisPenner/comonads-by-example.git`
2. `cd comonads-by-example && stack build`
