# Comonads By Example - Monadic Party 2019

Welcome! Here's where I'm keeping all my resources for the talk; inside [`src`](./src) you'll find a collection of
(hopefully) interesting examples of many different types of Comonads; as well as from-scratch implementations of
each of them.

If you plan to attend the sessions you may find it helpful to clone this repository and `stack build` ahead of
time.

Also please come with some of your own questions! I'd love to make the session as interactive as possible

I'll be posting full pdf versions of the slides here after the talks. Cheers üçª !
