#**Cofree**

#[fit] Comonads for _Kinda_ Free


---

#[fit] What's a __co__*free* comonad?

---

# *Free Monad* 

## a __Monad__ for any Functor

---

# __Co__*Free Comonad* 

## a Co__monad__ for any Functor

---

```haskell
data Cofree f a = a :< f (Cofree f a)
```

---

TODO: DIAGRAM OF Cofree Tree

---

Let's look at some comonads we've already seen

---

```haskell
type Stream a = Cofree Identity a
```

---

```haskell
[0, 1, 2, 3, ...]
=~
0 :< Identity (1 :< Identity (2 :< Identity (3 :< ...)))
```

---

```haskell
count :: Cofree Identity Int
count = 0 :< Identity (fmap (+1) count)
```

---

```haskell
coiter :: Functor f 
       => (a -> f a) 
       -> a 
       -> Cofree f a
```

---

```haskell
count' :: Cofree Identity Int
count' = coiter next 0
  where
    next :: Int -> Identity Int
    next n = Identity (n + 1)
```

---

```haskell
unfold :: Functor f 
        => (b -> (a, f b)) 
        -> b 
        -> Cofree f a

unfoldM :: (Traversable f, Monad m) 
        => (b -> m (a, f b)) 
        -> b 
        -> m (Cofree f a)
```

---

```haskell
type ??? a = Cofree Maybe a
```

---

```haskell
type NonEmpty a = Cofree Maybe a
```

---

```haskell
type NonEmpty a = Cofree Maybe a

alphabet :: NonEmpty Char
alphabet = coiter maybeNext 'a'
  where
    maybeNext :: Char -> Maybe Char
    maybeNext 'z' = Nothing
    maybeNext a   = Just $ succ a
```

---

```haskell
type Tree a = Cofree ??? a
```
---

```haskell
type Tree a = Cofree [] a
```

---

```haskell
simpleTree :: Cofree [] Char
simpleTree = 'a' :< [ 'b' :< ['c' :< []]
                    , 'd' :< []
                    ]
```

```haskell
type Tree a = Cofree [] a

fileTree :: IO (Tree FilePath)
fileTree = unfoldM crawl "."
  where
    crawl :: FilePath -> IO (FilePath, [FilePath])
    crawl path = (,) path <$> listDirectory' path
```

---

```haskell
type ??? e a = Cofree (Const e) a
```

---

```haskell
type Env e a = Cofree (Const e) a
```

---

```haskell
type Store s a = Cofree ??? a
```

---

```haskell
type Store s a = Cofree (Compose ??? ???) a
```

---

```haskell
type Store s a = Cofree (Compose ??? ((->) s)) a
```

---

```haskell
type Store s a = Cofree (Compose ((,) s) ((->) s)) a
```

---

```haskell
type ??? m a = Cofree ((->) m) a
```

---

```haskell
type Traced m a = Cofree ((->) m) a -- When `m` is a Monoid
```

---

```haskell
hoistCofree :: Functor f 
            => (forall x. f x -> g x) 
            -> Cofree f a 
            -> Cofree g a
```

# Comonad Transformers

---

```haskell
class ComonadTrans t where
lower :: Comonad w => t w a -> w a 
```

---

E.g.

```haskell
EnvT Int NonEmpty a

lower :: EnvT Int NonEmpty a -> NonEmpty a
```

---

# ZipperT

```haskell
ZipperT w a = ZipperT (Zipper (w a))

lower :: ZipperT w a -> w a
lower (ZipperT z) = extract z
```

---

# StoreT

```haskell
type Grid = StoreT (Store Int) Int a
```

---

```haskell
cohoist :: (Comonad w, Comonad v) 
        => (forall x. w x -> v x) 
        -> t w a 
        -> t v a
```

---

# Zipper?

---

```haskell
data Pair a = Pair a a
    deriving (Show, Eq, Functor, Foldable, Traversable)

type Zipper a = Cofree (Compose Pair Maybe) a

moveLeft :: Zipper Int -> Maybe (Zipper Int)
moveLeft (_ :< Compose (Pair l _)) = l

moveRight :: Zipper Int -> Maybe (Zipper Int)
moveRight (_ :< Compose (Pair _ r)) = r
```

---

```haskell
zipper :: Zipper Int
zipper = unfold move ([-1, -2], 0, [1, 2])
  where
    move :: ([Int], Int, [Int]) -> (Int, Compose Pair Maybe ([Int], Int, [Int]))
    move z@(_, focus, _) = (focus, Compose $ Pair (toLeft z) (toRight z))
    toRight (ls, focus, r:rs) = Just (focus:ls, r, rs)
    toRight (_, _, []) = Nothing
    toLeft (l:ls, focus, rs) = Just (ls, l, focus:rs)
    toLeft ([], _, _) = Nothing
```
