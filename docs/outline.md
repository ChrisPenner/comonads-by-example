## Comonads By Example

1.  Comonads
    -   A high level discussion of what comonads are good for including shallow
        descriptions of a few motivating examples (Zippers, Streams
         analyzing subtrees, etc)
    -   Implement the List Zipper comonad together and solve the 'trapped
        rainwater' google interview problem problem using 'extend'.
2.  Abstract Comonads
    -   Explore and implement some trivial comonads (Identity, Env).
    -   Take a *quick* peek at some other data comonads (Tree)
    -   Intro to the Store comonad, using pos and seek.
    -   Grid-based Comonads, exploring context using 'experiment'
    -   Conway's game of life aka cellular automata,
    -   Quick intro to representable functors ?  Control.Comonad.Representable.Store
    -   Implement Cellular Automata via Conway's game of life simulation using experiment
    -   Quick exploration of electricity and water flow simulations using
        similar techniques
3. Advanced Comonads & Using Cofree
    - Tic-Tac-Toe game using Cofree

4.  Image processing using Comonads
    -   Matrices as Representable Store Comonads
    -   Implement a simple sliding window 'Blur' using extend and experiment.
    -   Explore more complex image processing algorithms, e.g. edge detection,
        median colour selection, etc.
